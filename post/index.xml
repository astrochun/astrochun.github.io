      <title>Integrating an Overleaf git repo with your GitHub account (the right way!)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.overleaf.com&#34;&gt;Overleaf&lt;/a&gt; is an environment for researchers to
collaboratively write their manuscripts and papers with $\LaTeX$. It is
an amazing tool, but I have found that it has its limitations. For example,
if you edit within their web UI, each character change would show up as
separate changes in their History page.  One of the benefits of Overleaf
is that it is integrated with &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.  This is great as you can maintain
version control and document changes to your collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the power of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, I wanted to find a way to bring all the version
control to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and their nice UI to illustrate
changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across this tutorial:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ineed.coffee/3454/how-to-synchronize-an-overleaf-latex-paper-with-a-github-repository/&#34;&gt;https://ineed.coffee/3454/how-to-synchronize-an-overleaf-latex-paper-with-a-github-repository/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website was briefly down for a day, which worried me, so I felt it
might be good to preserve this tutorial in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
