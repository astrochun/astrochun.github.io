Earlier this year, the University of Arizona (UofA) announced it would start the Fall 2020 semester in a hybrid mode of in-person and online instruction, and had prepared for this re-entry in a number of ways. One of those priorities is testing of students, staff, and faculty to identify active cases. The UofA was not alone, as many other universities had implemented their own COVID-19 testing program.\nIn late August, the UofA provided summary data containing new daily tests (for the previous day) and cumulative numbers (July 31\u0026ndash;) on their main COVID-19 Updates webpage. Over time, it was clear that the numbers were not improving, but I grew frustrated as it was difficult to see quantitative trends. Prior to the start of the semester, it was said during a COVID-19 webinar that the COVID-19 dashboard would be made available in late August. So on September 3, I decided to start an independent volunteer project where I started to aggregate the summary data. I announced it on Twitter, and started with whatever screenshots I had saved and began putting the information in a Google Sheet, which I made publicly available for everyone to see. Over time, I had the help of a few UofA colleagues that connected with me through social media:\n Jill McCleary, Deputy Director and Acting Head at UofA Museum of Art Cheryl Knott, Professor in the School of Information Santiago Castiello-Gutiérrez, Ph.D. candidate in the Higher Education program  I am so thankful to them as this project would not have been possible without them.\nI chose Google Sheet for many reasons:\n Easy to use Easy to publish Easy to collaborate Easy to make charts/graphs As a programmer, built-in version control  This project was very much #openscience as hundreds of users checked out the spreadsheet daily to look at the latest updates. Since many users viewed it anonymously, it was hard to get exact numbers, but this was what I found from Twitter, Google, and Bitly tracking.\n I estimate a total of 545 clicks on either the original Google or Bitly link 393 (72%) of those clicks were through Twitter and Facebook The spreadsheet was shared via other platforms (SMS, email, etc.) for nearly 152 additional clicks (28%) There were 146 unique non-anonymous viewers to the Google Sheet Using Bitly, I was able to see that viewers included those in at least ten different foreign countries.  This all happened mostly during a nearly two-week period before the COVID-19 dashboard went live on September 16.\nThe source of information came from my colleagues, UofA's weekly re-entry broadcasting, and using the WayBackMachine to go back and look at the websites. After all the data were aggregated, there was a lot of quality control as some numbers disagreed, and that needed to be recorded in the Google Sheet with in-cell comments and source identification. This is what we call good data management practice. Then, after I felt confident of all the numbers, I put together graphs that summarized the testing data.\nThe final culmination of this hard work by my colleagues and I is publishing the final table and visualization in the UofA Research Data Repository. The work is titled \u0026ldquo;Independent Data Aggregation, Quality Control and Visualization of University of Arizona COVID-19 Re-Entry Testing Data\u0026rdquo; and is made available under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) public domain license:\n Final Thoughts I really enjoyed being able to share what I learned with the UofA community. I found myself needing to make this happen so everyone knew how fast COVID-19 was spreading in the UofA community. We all need to pull together to fight back, and gathering, checking and illustrating information was the best way for me to go about it.\n#StaySafe, #BearDown, and #MaskUp!\n","date":1601164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601164800,"objectID":"f9e39e3974241612ecdcacb8e97013ed","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/post/covid19_research/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid19_research/","section":"post","summary":"Without a doubt, COVID-19 has impacted every aspect of life, especially higher education.

This is great as you can maintain version control and document changes to your collaborators.\nWith the power of git, I wanted to find a way to bring all the version control to GitHub and their nice UI to illustrate changes.\nI came across this tutorial!\nThe trick is using the default git remote command.\nStep 1: Sign up for a free account at Overleaf and create a new project (I recommend the \u0026ldquo;Example Project\u0026rdquo; option):\n   Step 1: Create a new Overleaf project   Step 2: Retrieve the git clone command by selecting the Menu button in the upper left and the Git option:\n   Step 2: Retrieve git clone command   You should see a pop-up window containing something similar to:\n git clone https://git.overleaf.com/\u0026lt;ABCDEF123456\u0026gt;  Here I use \u0026lt;ABCDEF123456\u0026gt; as a placeholder for the real path throughout this post.\nStep 3: Open up a command-line terminal and execute this git clone command and finish it with a more meaningful project name:\n$ git clone https://git.overleaf.com/\u0026lt;ABCDEF123456\u0026gt; git_integration_project $ cd git_integration_project  You now have a copy of your Overleaf project locally!

This is very important as the content will be populated from your Overleaf repository! Also, I made it a private repository.

One of the major drivers for researchers is the requirement from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NASA, NIH, DoE) of a data management plan. Data repositories, such as, Dataverse, Zenodo, and Figshare are being used across all disciplines, including science, humanities, medicine, and technology to satisfy funder's requirements and other needs (e.g., publishers requirements). These repository services focus on following the guiding data principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).\nIn addition to these public repositories, R-1 universities have been providing institutional data repositories to serve the greater needs of their university. These repositories also enable university administration to track research output and productivity.\nMotivated by a number of factors, the University of Arizona Libraries is leading the effort to develop and sustain a data repository with funding from the Provost Investment Fund. The repository, called ReDATA, will be hosted through an institutional Figshare site.\nMore information about ReDATA is available here.\nIn my current role as Research Data Systems Integration Specialist, I:\n Develop front- and/or back-end software to enable and automate identity and access management, data curation, and data preservation, and deploying them on cloud infrastructure Engage with major campus stakeholders to identify and develop workflows for integrating ReDATA with existing library, campus computing, and research administration systems, such as, single-sign on (SSO) with the University's enterprise-level Shibboleth system, ORCiD, and UofA HPC infrastructure Engage with researchers across campus to use the data repository for open and reproducible science Participate in discussions regarding data repository policies.

I learned that while Gemini has provided an IRAF reduction pipeline, automated implementation of this pipeline has been limited. For example, this website provided a number of tutorials, but ultimately the user needed to create scripts to execute, as this example script demonstrates. While Gemini recently released the DRAGONS Python-based data reduction pipeline, reduction is limited to imaging data.\nThe Automation Pipeline With spectra taken on several dozens of nights, automation was critical to expedite data reduction for my project. Thus, I created a Python/PyRAF pipeline that used the existing Gemini IRAF package. This automation pipeline is made publicly available on GitHub and distributed under an MIT License. Because of the dependence on PyRAF/IRAF, this code is only compatible with Python 2.7.\nThe pipeline has several features:\n Longslit target acquisition checks with quality assurance (QA) visualization Correct detector readout artefacts with CLEANIR routine Flat fielding Wavelength calibration Dithered stacking Telluric flux calibration Spectral extraction  Installation Installation is best done by cloning the GitHub repository and installing PyRAF.\nThis page is under construction.

Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxies Using the MMT, Keck, and Subaru observatories, my collaborators and I have targeted some of these faint galaxies with optical and near-infrared spectrographs. We found a rare population of galaxies that are rapidly forming at an unexpected rate. Many of these galaxies show signs of interactions with other nearby galaxies (see below). We believe that these interactions trigger the extreme bursts of star formation that we see. With detections of a very weak line, [OIII]λ4363, we were able to determine that these galaxies do not have significant heavy elements. In fact, a few of our galaxies have the most metal pristine gas seen for galaxies outside the local Universe. I am trying to understand why these galaxies have so few metals. One interpretation is that these galaxy interactions can drive new metal pristine gas into the galaxies, \\making it appear \u0026ldquo;metal-poor\u0026rdquo; and fueling recent star formation.
