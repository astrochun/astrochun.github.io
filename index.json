While this allowed for the easy viewing of information for an individual, the analysis from the Daily Wildcat was rather limited. As such, I wanted to build a data visualization app that allow anyone to explore the data for 100% transparency.\nHow The salary data were available as machine-readable CSV files, so it made sense to build a Python application that uses pandas to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data. I heard about streamlit, a Python web framework that would make it faster to build such an app. Essentially streamlit provides a RESTful application programming interface (API) with a front-end layer that interacts with Python scripts that do data analysis and visualization. It took me about a weekend to understand streamlit and its \u0026ldquo;widgets\u0026rdquo;, which are interactive tools that could be used to perform ETL actions with the data. From there, I put together the software to load the data and provide different \u0026ldquo;data views\u0026rdquo; that were different interactions with the data. The code is available on GitHub under an MIT License. There are many resources and blogs about building a streamlit, so I won't go in details here, but I will illustrate some aspects:\nLoading in data can be simple.\nimport pandas as pd import streamlit as st # List of fiscal years FY_LIST = [ 'FY2019-20', 'FY2018-19', 'FY2017-18', 'FY2016-17', 'FY2014-15', 'FY2013-14', 'FY2011-12', ] @st.cache def load_data(): file_id = { 'FY2019-20': '1d2l29_T-mOh05bglPlwAFlzeV1PIkRXd', 'FY2018-19': '1paxrUyW1wZuK3bjSL_L7ckKEC6xslZJe', 'FY2017-18': '1AnRaPpbRTLVyqdeqe6vkPMYgbNnw9zia', 'FY2016-17': '1rXBuuXit5oWKtfnA05gsNtsWAyESeIs2', 'FY2014-15': '1ZANVDr6Kw40MJYiOENWbLMTFEMWyf7f4', 'FY2013-14': '1rQ8A2CIVhDYu0lESKVh72h6VUd8gIEFl', 'FY2011-12': '1fQOzEHiOvc_H1NcLMlK3KVV1DJkRbRuX', } data_dict = {} for year in FY_LIST: data_dict[year] = pd.read_csv( f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id[year]}' ) return data_dict def main(): # Load data data_dict = load_data()  The above code loads every previous year's of available data into a dict of pandas DataFrames. The st.cache decorator ensures that the data is loaded into memory once. This ensures a shorter response time when it's deployed and users are accessing the app frequently. Here, I made the data publicly available in Google Drive. I could have gone with an SQL server, but given the small record sizes (~10,000 records), and the reliability of Google Drive, this worked well for an MVP.\nTo select from the data, I utilized streamlit sidebar widgets to add the layer for selection. For example, the following selects the data for one fiscal year:\ndef select_fiscal_year() -\u0026gt; str: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Sidebar widget to select fiscal year\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; st.sidebar.markdown('### Select fiscal year:') fy_select = st.sidebar.selectbox('', FY_LIST, index=0).split(' ')[0] return fy_select def main(): # Load data data_dict = load_data() fy_select = select_fiscal_year() # Select dataframe df = data_dict[fy_select] st.sidebar.text(f\u0026quot;{fy_select} data imported!\u0026quot;)  This results in something that looks like this:\n   Sidebar tool selection for fiscal year   As discussed earlier, interactions with the data is done with different views. Currently, I have five of them:\n Trends: General facts and numbers (e.g. number of employees, salary budget), for each fiscal year Salary Summary: Statistics and percentile salary data, includes salary histogram Highest Earners: Extract data above a minimum salary College/Division Data: Similar to Salary Summary but extracted for each college(s)/division(s) Department Data: Similar to Salary Summary but extracted for each department(s)  This can easily be done on the side and then the main page is loaded\nDATA_VIEWS = [ 'About', 'Trends', 'Salary Summary', 'Highest Earners', 'College/Division Data', 'Department Data' ] def select_data_view() -\u0026gt; str: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Sidebar widget to select your data view\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; st.sidebar.markdown('### Select your data view:') view_select = st.sidebar.selectbox('', DATA_VIEWS, index=0) return view_select def main(): # Sidebar, select data view view_select = select_data_view() if view_select == 'About': views.about_page() if view_select == 'Trends': views.trends_page(data_dict, pay_norm) if view_select == 'Salary Summary': views.salary_summary_page(df, pay_norm) if view_select == 'Highest Earners': views.highest_earners_page(df) # Select by College Name if view_select == 'College/Division Data': views.subset_select_data_page(df, COLLEGE_NAME, 'college', pay_norm) # Select by Department Name if view_select == 'Department Data': views.subset_select_data_page(df, 'Department', 'department', pay_norm)  Here views is a module and each of its function displays different content in the main page.

In 2020, UArizona completed the University Career Architecture Project (UCAP), which map every employee to specific career streams. I recently submitted a public request for FY2020-21 data that includes UCAP and other demographics (e.g. sex, race, ethnicity). In fact, UCAP was my original motivation for this app. With a proper mapping of career streams, any UArizona member could easily compare their salary against those across the campus with the same job responsibilities.\nOnce I have these data, I'll then add additional views to explore the UCAP classification and other demographics.\nSupport it!

I figured it might be worthwhile to do a quick one on the recent web scraping work that I did.\nVox Charta, a web application that allowed astronomers to vote and discuss about the latest manuscripts made available on arXiv, was conceived in 2009 by James Guillochon. It was used by thousands of astronomers internationally as there was no other options available for several years. Unfortunately, it was announced that the service would be sunsetted on December 31, 2020.\nPersonally I used Vox Charta since 2011 and have utilized its voting method to record astronomy papers of interest to me. When I heard the news of the sunset I immediately knew that I needed to #preserve my voting records. There were over 2,000 papers of interest to me!\nSo I went forth and built a simple Python software to extract that information. The \u0026ldquo;My Voting Records\u0026rdquo; content was stored in HTML, so it made sense to use BeautifulSoup for extraction! It was quite fun to solve this problem; this was my first time building a web scraping tool. Loading the content was pretty straightforward:\nimport re from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import json import pandas as pd class Extract: def __init__(self, filename, json_outfile, csv_outfile): self.log = log self.filename = filename self.json_outfile = json_outfile self.csv_outfile = csv_outfile self.content = self.import_data() def import_data(self): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Import data\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; with open(self.filename, 'r') as f: content = f.read() f.close() return content def soup_it(self): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Construct BeautifulSoup data structure\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; page_content = BeautifulSoup(self.content, \u0026quot;html.parser\u0026quot;) return page_content  Because the exported HTML was not as well structured, some trial and error was needed to figure out how to extract specific content. In the end, I was able to scrape the arXiv ID, title, author list, author affiliation, abstract, arXiv categories, links, comments, and many other information. The method to retrieve the voting records is too long to put it here, but you can see it here.\nThen, I added the ability to export the content to two machine-readable forms.\ndef export_data(self, records_dict): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Write JSON and csv files\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; with open(self.json_outfile, 'w') as outfile: json.dump(records_dict, outfile, indent=4) df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(records_dict, orient='index') df.to_csv(self.csv_outfile, index=False) # Write arxiv_id list arxiv_outfile = self.csv_outfile.replace('.csv', '_arxiv.txt') clean_df = df.loc[(df['arxiv_id'] != '') \u0026amp; (df['arxiv_id'].notna())] clean_df.to_csv(arxiv_outfile, index=False, header=False, columns=['arxiv_id'])  As you can see, two types of files are provided: JSON and CSV. The latter is done with pandas. An example of the exported JSON output is available below.\n   I then provided my voting records to the maintainers of the Benty-Fields web application. It has many features that are similar to Vox Charta by allowing for discussions and voting. In the end, those records were transferred over!\n   If you're interested in using this code, it is available here. The code is made available under a GNU GPL-3.0 License so other astronomers can preserve their precious Vox Charta records.\nThe README.md provides more details, but here are some quick installation and execution steps:\n  Download the complete webpage view from the \u0026ldquo;My Voting Record\u0026rdquo; page before the site is permanently down\n  Clone the repo:\n$ git clone https://github.com/astrochun/voxcharta-my-voting-record    Build it (preferably in a contained environment)\n$ cd voxcharta-my-voting-record $ (sudo) python setup.py install    You can then easily execute the main script:\n$ vox_run -f myvotingrecords.htm    Many thanks to James Guillochon for being the selfless maintainer of Vox Charta for over a decade. I'm also thankful to the Benty-Fields maintainers for their help.\nIf you found this open-source software useful, consider sponsoring me through GitHub.\n ","date":1608940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608940800,"objectID":"d5a7273a9c1d9088fca8c085270dd59f","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/post/voxcharta_preserve/","publishdate":"2020-12-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/voxcharta_preserve/","section":"post","summary":"It's been a few months since I have done a tech/hacking post.

Earlier this year, the University of Arizona (UofA) announced it would start the Fall 2020 semester in a hybrid mode of in-person and online instruction, and had prepared for this re-entry in a number of ways. One of those priorities is testing of students, staff, and faculty to identify active cases. The UofA was not alone, as many other universities had implemented their own COVID-19 testing program.\nIn late August, the UofA provided summary data containing new daily tests (for the previous day) and cumulative numbers (July 31\u0026ndash;) on their main COVID-19 Updates webpage. Over time, it was clear that the numbers were not improving, but I grew frustrated as it was difficult to see quantitative trends. Prior to the start of the semester, it was said during a COVID-19 webinar that the COVID-19 dashboard would be made available in late August. So on September 3, I decided to start an independent volunteer project where I started to aggregate the summary data. I announced it on Twitter, and started with whatever screenshots I had saved and began putting the information in a Google Sheet, which I made publicly available for everyone to see. Over time, I had the help of a few UofA colleagues that connected with me through social media:\n Jill McCleary, Deputy Director and Acting Head at UofA Museum of Art Cheryl Knott, Professor in the School of Information Santiago Castiello-GutiÃ©rrez, Ph.D. candidate in the Higher Education program  I am so thankful to them as this project would not have been possible without them.\nI chose Google Sheet for many reasons:\n Easy to use Easy to publish Easy to collaborate Easy to make charts/graphs As a programmer, built-in version control  This project was very much #openscience as hundreds of users checked out the spreadsheet daily to look at the latest updates. Since many users viewed it anonymously, it was hard to get exact numbers, but this was what I found from Twitter, Google, and Bitly tracking.\n I estimate a total of 545 clicks on either the original Google or Bitly link 393 (72%) of those clicks were through Twitter and Facebook The spreadsheet was shared via other platforms (SMS, email, etc.) for nearly 152 additional clicks (28%) There were 146 unique non-anonymous viewers to the Google Sheet Using Bitly, I was able to see that viewers included those in at least ten different foreign countries.  This all happened mostly during a nearly two-week period before the COVID-19 dashboard went live on September 16.\nThe source of information came from my colleagues, UofA's weekly re-entry broadcasting, and using the WayBackMachine to go back and look at the websites. After all the data were aggregated, there was a lot of quality control as some numbers disagreed, and that needed to be recorded in the Google Sheet with in-cell comments and source identification. This is what we call good data management practice. A preview of the machine-readable consolidated spreadsheet is available below:\n\nThen, after I felt confident of all the numbers, I put together graphs that summarized the testing data.\nThe final culmination of this hard work by my colleagues and I is publishing the final table and visualization in the UofA Research Data Repository. The work is titled \u0026ldquo;Independent Data Aggregation, Quality Control and Visualization of University of Arizona COVID-19 Re-Entry Testing Data\u0026rdquo; and is made available under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) public domain license:\n\nFinal Thoughts I really enjoyed being able to share what I learned with the UofA community. I found myself needing to make this happen so everyone knew how fast COVID-19 was spreading in the UofA community. We all need to pull together to fight back, and gathering, checking and illustrating information was the best way for me to go about it.\n#StaySafe, #BearDown, and #MaskUp!\n","date":1601164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601164800,"objectID":"f9e39e3974241612ecdcacb8e97013ed","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/post/covid19_research/","publishdate":"2020-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid19_research/","section":"post","summary":"Without a doubt, COVID-19 has impacted every aspect of life, especially higher education.

One of the major drivers for researchers is the requirement from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NASA, NIH, DoE) of a data management plan. Data repositories, such as, Dataverse, Zenodo, and Figshare are being used across all disciplines, including science, humanities, medicine, and technology to satisfy funder's requirements and other needs (e.g., publishers requirements). These repository services focus on following the guiding data principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).\nIn addition to these public repositories, R-1 universities have been providing institutional data repositories to serve the greater needs of their university. These repositories also enable university administration to track research output and productivity.\nMotivated by a number of factors, the University of Arizona Libraries is leading the effort to develop and sustain a data repository with funding from the Provost Investment Fund. The repository, called ReDATA, will be hosted through an institutional Figshare site.\nMore information about ReDATA is available here.\nIn my current role as Research Data Systems Integration Specialist, I:\n Develop front- and/or back-end software to enable and automate identity and access management, data curation, and data preservation, and deploying them on cloud infrastructure Engage with major campus stakeholders to identify and develop workflows for integrating ReDATA with existing library, campus computing, and research administration systems, such as, single-sign on (SSO) with the University's enterprise-level Shibboleth system, ORCiD, and UofA HPC infrastructure Engage with researchers across campus to use the data repository for open and reproducible science Participate in discussions regarding data repository policies.

With coverage of 1\u0026ndash;5$\\mu$m, it remains a work-horse facility instrument on the Gemini North telescope in Hawai`i.\nRecently, I used this instrument to obtain near-infrared spectra for low-mass galaxies at $z\\approx0.8$. I learned that while Gemini has provided an IRAF reduction pipeline, automated implementation of this pipeline has been limited. For example, this website provided a number of tutorials, but ultimately the user needed to create scripts to execute, as this example script demonstrates. While Gemini recently released the DRAGONS Python-based data reduction pipeline, reduction is limited to imaging data.\nThe Automation Pipeline With spectra taken on several dozens of nights, automation was critical to expedite data reduction for my project. Thus, I created a Python/PyRAF pipeline that used the existing Gemini IRAF package. This automation pipeline is made publicly available on GitHub and distributed under an MIT License. Because of the dependence on PyRAF/IRAF, this code is only compatible with Python 2.7.\nThe pipeline has several features:\n Longslit target acquisition checks with quality assurance (QA) visualization Correct detector readout artefacts with CLEANIR routine Flat fielding Wavelength calibration Dithered stacking Telluric flux calibration Spectral extraction  Installation Installation is best done by cloning the GitHub repository and installing PyRAF.\nThis page is under construction.

This camera enables images to be taken over a large part of the sky that is comparable to the angular extent of the Moon. The large area allows us to look at hundreds of thousands of galaxies simultaneously.\n   Areal comparison of the SDF against the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and the Moon   Why stare for so long? To identify some of the faintest galaxies in the early universe! To do so, the survey utilized a unique technique called \u0026ldquo;narrowband imaging\u0026rdquo; to pick up emission from hydrogen and oxygen gas that reside within galaxies.\n   Narrowband and intermediate filters for the SDF (adapted from Ly et al. 2014)   I.

Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxies Using the MMT, Keck, and Subaru observatories, my collaborators and I have targeted some of these faint galaxies with optical and near-infrared spectrographs. We found a rare population of galaxies that are rapidly forming at an unexpected rate. Many of these galaxies show signs of interactions with other nearby galaxies (see below). We believe that these interactions trigger the extreme bursts of star formation that we see. With detections of a very weak line, [OIII]Î»4363, we were able to determine that these galaxies do not have significant heavy elements. In fact, a few of our galaxies have the most metal pristine gas seen for galaxies outside the local Universe. I am trying to understand why these galaxies have so few metals. One interpretation is that these galaxy interactions can drive new metal pristine gas into the galaxies, \\making it appear \u0026ldquo;metal-poor\u0026rdquo; and fueling recent star formation. You can find more information in our paper.\nVII. This page is under construction.

These spectra have provided accurate redshifts for $\\approx$40,000 galaxies. While the spectra were primarily used to determine distances/redshifts using two emission lines, a subset of the sample (4,140 galaxies) contains spectral coverage that span 3700\u0026ndash;5010 Angstroms, enabling gas-phase chemical abundance determination.\nUsing the publicly available data, I identified a large sample of 28 galaxies with detection of $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$, a gas temperature diagnostics.\n   Illustration of eight galaxies with $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$ detections (Ly et al. 2015)   This work, titled \u0026ldquo;Metal-poor, Strongly Star-forming Galaxies in the DEEP2 Survey: The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Temperature-based Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate\u0026quot;, is published in the Astrophysical Journal.\nSpitzer follow-up imaging to characterize stellar population While the spectra enabled us to characterize the interstellar gas properties of these metal-poor galaxies, understanding the stellar properties of these $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$-detected galaxies requires observations in the infrared to detect the light from low-mass stars. Using the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, I obtained deep imaging at 3.6 $\\mu$m.\n   Spitzer/IRAC observations of all 28 metal-poor galaxies from Ly et al. (2015)   These observations demonstrated that these galaxies are very faint, and can be classified as \u0026ldquo;dwarf\u0026rdquo; galaxies. In addition, our work illustrated a strong evolution in the mass\u0026ndash;metallicity relation, $(1+z)^{-1.45^{+0.61}_{-0.76}}$. Specifically, we find that lower mass galaxies ($4\\times10^8~M_{\\odot}$) built up their metal content 1.6 times more rapidly than higher mass galaxies ($10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$). We also found that there is not a secondary dependence on star formation in the mass\u0026ndash;metallicity relation.\nThis work is now published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society as a first-author paper for Drew Weldon, a former undergraduate astronomy major at the UofA and now attending UC Riverside for graduate school.\n","date":1576368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576368000,"objectID":"784f4fcf0bd556c97ba2bed970a9053b","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/project/deep2/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deep2/","section":"project","summary":"Using public data to understand chemical enrichment in galaxies","tags":["Research","Galaxy evolution","Chemical enrichment"],"title":"DEEP2 Survey","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Evolution of the Mass\u0026ndash;Metallicity Relation Main Sequence Relation of Extremely Low-Mass Galaxies ","date":1575763200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575763200,"objectID":"9723091a083201349047b3aae22f524a","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/project/mact/","publishdate":"2019-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mact/","section":"project","summary":"Spectroscopic survey of emission-line galaxies to understand galaxy evolution","tags":["Research","Galaxy evolution","Chemical enrichment"],"title":"Metal Abundances across Cosmic Time","type":"project"},{"authors":["Charlie Conroy","Ana Bonaca","Phillip Cargile","Benjamin D.
