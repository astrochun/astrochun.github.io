These spectra have provided accurate redshifts for $\\approx$40,000 galaxies. While the spectra were primarily used to determine distances/redshifts using two emission lines, a subset of the sample (4,140 galaxies) contains spectral coverage that span 3700\u0026ndash;5010 Angstroms, enabling gas-phase chemical abundance determination.\nUsing the publicly available data, I identified a large sample of 28 galaxies with detection of $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$, a gas temperature diagnostics.\n   Illustration of eight galaxies with $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$ detections (Ly et al. 2015)   This work, titled \u0026ldquo;Metal-poor, Strongly Star-forming Galaxies in the DEEP2 Survey: The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Temperature-based Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate\u0026quot;, is published in the Astrophysical Journal.\nSpitzer follow-up imaging to characterize stellar population While the spectra enabled us to characterize the interstellar gas properties of these metal-poor galaxies, understanding the stellar properties of these $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$-detected galaxies requires observations in the infrared to detect the light from low-mass stars. Using the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, I obtained deep imaging at 3.6 $\\mu$m.\n   Spitzer/IRAC observations of all 28 metal-poor galaxies from Ly et al. (2015)   These observations demonstrated that these galaxies are very faint, and can be classified as \u0026ldquo;dwarf\u0026rdquo; galaxies. In addition, our work illustrated a strong evolution in the mass\u0026ndash;metallicity relation, $(1+z)^{-1.45^{+0.61}_{-0.76}}$. Specifically, we find that lower mass galaxies ($4\\times10^8~M_{\\odot}$) built up their metal content 1.6 times more rapidly than higher mass galaxies ($10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$). We also found that there is not a secondary dependence on star formation in the mass\u0026ndash;metallicity relation.\nThis work is now published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society as a first-author paper for Drew Weldon, a former undergraduate astronomy major at the UofA and now attending UC Riverside for graduate school.\n","date":1576368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576368000,"objectID":"784f4fcf0bd556c97ba2bed970a9053b","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/project/deep2/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deep2/","section":"project","summary":"Using public data to understand chemical enrichment in galaxies","tags":["Research","Galaxy evolution","Chemical enrichment"],"title":"DEEP2 Survey","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page is under construction.
