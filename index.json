This camera enables images to be taken over a large part of the sky that is comparable to the angular extent of the Moon. The large area allows us to look at hundreds of thousands of galaxies simultaneously. Why stare for so long? To identify some of the faintest galaxies in the early universe! To do so, the survey utilized a technique called \u0026ldquo;narrowband imaging\u0026rdquo; to pick up emission from hydrogen and oxygen gas that reside within galaxies.\n   Areal comparison of the SDF against the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and the Moon   Using the MMT, Keck, and Subaru observatories, my collaborators and I have targeted some of these faint galaxies with optical and near-infrared spectrographs. We found a rare population of galaxies that are rapidly forming at an unexpected rate. Many of these galaxies show signs of interactions with other nearby galaxies (see below). We believe that these interactions trigger the extreme bursts of star formation that we see. With detections of a very weak line, [OIII]λ4363, we were able to determine that these galaxies do not have significant heavy elements. In fact, a few of our galaxies have the most metal pristine gas seen for galaxies outside the local Universe. I am trying to understand why these galaxies have so few metals. One interpretation is that these galaxy interactions can drive new metal pristine gas into the galaxies, \\making it appear \u0026ldquo;metal-poor\u0026rdquo; and fueling recent star formation. You can find more information in our paper.\nThis page is under construction.

These spectra have provided accurate redshifts for $\\approx$40,000 galaxies. While the spectra were primarily used to determine distances/redshifts using two emission lines, a subset of the sample (4,140 galaxies) contains spectral coverage that span 3700\u0026ndash;5010 Angstroms, enabling gas-phase chemical abundance determination.\nUsing the publicly available data, I identified a large sample of 28 galaxies with detection of $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$, a gas temperature diagnostics.\n   Illustration of eight galaxies with $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$ detections (Ly et al. 2015)   This work, titled \u0026ldquo;Metal-poor, Strongly Star-forming Galaxies in the DEEP2 Survey: The Relationship between Stellar Mass, Temperature-based Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate\u0026quot;, is published in the Astrophysical Journal.\nSpitzer follow-up imaging to characterize stellar population While the spectra enabled us to characterize the interstellar gas properties of these metal-poor galaxies, understanding the stellar properties of these $[{\\rm O~{\\small III}}]\\lambda4363$-detected galaxies requires observations in the infrared to detect the light from low-mass stars. Using the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, I obtained deep imaging at 3.6 $\\mu$m.\n   Spitzer/IRAC observations of all 28 metal-poor galaxies from Ly et al. (2015)   These observations demonstrated that these galaxies are very faint, and can be classified as \u0026ldquo;dwarf\u0026rdquo; galaxies. In addition, our work illustrated a strong evolution in the mass\u0026ndash;metallicity relation, $(1+z)^{-1.45^{+0.61}_{-0.76}}$. Specifically, we find that lower mass galaxies ($4\\times10^8~M_{\\odot}$) built up their metal content 1.6 times more rapidly than higher mass galaxies ($10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$). We also found that there is not a secondary dependence on star formation in the mass\u0026ndash;metallicity relation.\nThis work is now published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society as a first-author paper for Drew Weldon, a former undergraduate astronomy major at the UofA and now attending UC Riverside for graduate school.\n","date":1576368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576368000,"objectID":"784f4fcf0bd556c97ba2bed970a9053b","permalink":"https://astrochun.github.io/project/deep2/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deep2/","section":"project","summary":"Using public data to understand chemical enrichment in galaxies","tags":["Research","Galaxy evolution","Chemical enrichment"],"title":"DEEP2 Survey","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview The Gemini Near-Infrared Spectograph (GNIRS) was commissioned in 2004 by the Gemini Observatory.
